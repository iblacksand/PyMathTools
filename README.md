[mod](https://github.com/iblacksand/PyMathTools/wiki/mod) - a more advanced mod that has correct inverses

[to_ints](https://github.com/iblacksand/PyMathTools/wiki/to_ints) - converts an array of a type to ints

[read_file](https://github.com/iblacksand/PyMathTools/wiki/read_file) - reads a file of floats and puts it into an array of floats

[latex_gen_graph](https://github.com/iblacksand/PyMathTools/wiki/latex_gen_graph) - takes a 2d array of points and converts it into a tikz graph

[elliptic_card](https://github.com/iblacksand/PyMathTools/wiki/elliptic_card) - finds the cardinality of an elliptic curve

[is_prime](https://github.com/iblacksand/PyMathTools/wiki/is_prime) - checks if a number is prime
